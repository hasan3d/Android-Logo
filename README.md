# Android Logo 

I have build this logo as a part of the project assigned by The Odin Project(http://www.theodinproject.com). In the process of making this logo, I have used CSS3 Properties such as transition, transform and border-radious etc.

#####In order to see the full effect hover over the head, left and right arm section of the logo.
